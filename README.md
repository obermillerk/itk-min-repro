# itk-min-repro
Currently uses the web version of itk's readImageDICOMFileSeries, as opposed to the local version.

## Quick start
```bash
yarn # install dependencies
yarn start # launch app
```

```bash
npm i # install dependencies
npm run start # launch app
```

Once running, use the `Select Directory` button to choose a directory in the pop up window, which will trigger an attempt to read the image files via itk.
